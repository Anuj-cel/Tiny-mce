@tinymce/tinymce-react = 
This is the official React wrapper for
TinyMCE
TinyMCE itself is plain JavaScript.
React needs a bridge to use it properly.
<Editor />

tinymce=
This is the actual editor engine.
The toolbar, formatting, HTML generation — everything.
Without this, the React wrapper has nothing to render.
Think of it like:
@tinymce/tinymce-react → steering wheel
tinymce → engine

prismjs
What is it?
Prism
A JavaScript library that adds color coding to code blocks.
TinyMCE does NOT color code syntax.

<pre><code class="language-javascript">
console.log("Hello");
</code></pre>

Prism:
Reads the language class
Parses the code
Wraps keywords in spans
Applies CSS colors
